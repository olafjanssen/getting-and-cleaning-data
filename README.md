# Getting and Cleaning Data

## How to use this repo

The file `run_analysis.R` contains code that downloads and unzips the original "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data-set. From this, it generates a tidy data set `tidy_data.txt` that contains the means per subject and activity of the mean and standard deviation data in the original dataset.

More details on the variables used in the dataset see the `CodeBook.md`.
